                        <p>We help you avail the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) subsidies for solar installations, making clean energy more affordable. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) offers a subsidy program to make solar energy accessible and affordable for everyone. Through this government-backed initiative, homeowners can receive up to 40% financial assistance on rooftop solar installations. This means lower upfront costs, quicker return on investment, and long-term savings on electricity bills.</p>
