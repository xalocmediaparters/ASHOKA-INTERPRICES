# Floating Button Fix Task

## Steps to Complete:
1. [x] Update CSS in `assets/css/styles.css` with enhanced responsive rules for floating button positioning, sizing, and z-index.
2. [x] Verify no overlaps or extra space by reviewing layout (no tool execution needed yet).
3. [x] Test responsiveness across breakpoints (manual via browser after update).
4. [x] Complete task and provide final corrected code snippets.

Progress: CSS updates applied successfully. The floating button is now fixed-positioned with improved responsive sizing (55px base, scaling down to 45px on small screens), higher z-index (9999), safe-area support for iOS, reduced animation amplitude, and new breakpoints for tablets (1024px) and mobile landscape (768px) to prevent overlaps and extra space on mobile devices viewing the desktop site.
